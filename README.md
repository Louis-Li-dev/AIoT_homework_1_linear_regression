# Linear Regression â€” CRISP-DM Demo

This project demonstrates **Linear Regression** following the CRISP-DM process.  
It provides two deployment options for interactive exploration:

- **Streamlit app** â€” rich UI for experimenting with slope, intercept, noise, and dataset size.
- **Flask app** â€” lightweight web interface for adjusting parameters and viewing results.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Synthetic linear data generation with configurable slope `a`, intercept `b`, noise, and number of points.
- Model training and evaluation with `scikit-learn`:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - RÂ² Score
- Interactive visualization of regression results.
- Two deployment frameworks:
  - **Streamlit** â€” data exploration with sliders and metrics panel.
  - **Flask** â€” simple form-based UI with matplotlib plot.
